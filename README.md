This software is not currently being maintained, and it may be a while before this project is picked up again.
Until that happens, detailed below are the libraries required to compile this software in its present state.

- [libctru 1.5.0](https://github.com/devkitPro/libctru/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

Newer versions of these libraries *may* work, however these were the versions available at the time of this project's previous commit (Aug 2018).
